# Codota maven plugin
Maven plugin for [indexing java/scala code in Codota](https://www.codota.com/index-your-repo)

You can easily send your Java code for indexing by adding this simple maven plugin which collects your artifacts and uploads them to your secure private Codota account.

### Uploading your artifacts for analysis
To submit your code follow these simple steps:
* [Create your private account at Codota](https://www.codota.com/submit-repo/maven)
* Build your project including sources and send to Codota for indexing by running the following command in your project directory
    
    ```
    mvn clean source:jar source:test-jar jar:test-jar package com.codota:codota-uploader:1.0.4:upload -Dcodota.token={your_token_here} -Dcodota.endpoint=https://upload.codota.com/artifacts -DskipAssembly -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dgpg.skip
    ```
    Also, you have the following optional parameters:
    ```
    -Dcodota.repoName={your_repo_name} -Dcodota.lastPushed={utc_format_datetime}
    ```
    Make sure to use the secure token you receive from Codota. Please make sure to keep your token private and secure.
    Indexing usually takes less than an hour - you'll get an email once it's ready

* To permanently add upload to Codota in your build, paste the following in your pom.xml under <build><plugins> - make sure to use the secure token you receive from Codota. Please make sure to keep your token private and secure.
